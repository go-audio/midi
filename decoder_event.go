		All Sound Off
		c = 120, v = 0
		When All Sound Off is received all oscillators will turn off,
		and their volume envelopes are set to zero as soon as possible.

		Reset All Controllers
		c = 121, v = x
		When Reset All Controllers is received, all controller values are reset to their default values.
		Value must only be zero unless otherwise allowed in a specific Recommended Practice.

		Local Control.
		c = 122, v = 0: Local Control Off
		c = 122, v = 127: Local Control On
		When Local Control is Off, all devices on a given channel will respond only to data received over MIDI.
		Played data, etc. will be ignored. Local Control On restores the functions of the normal controllers.

		All Notes Off.
		c = 123, v = 0: All Notes Off (See text for description of actual mode commands.)
		c = 124, v = 0: Omni Mode Off
		c = 125, v = 0: Omni Mode On

		c = 127, v = 0: Poly Mode On (Mono Off) (Note: These four messages also cause All Notes Off)
