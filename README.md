## Alternative

Depending on your needs, you might want to check out the excellent
[gomidi](https://github.com/gomidi/midi) library by
[metakeule](https://github.com/metakeule). His library is lower level but more
complete and offers support for live MIDI messaging which this library isn't
trying to do.
